# hello-cometd

This is a minimal hello world example how to use CometD (http://cometd.org/) in Clojure. It is almost the same example as its Java equivalent in the CometD primer (http://cometd.org/documentation/howtos/primer).

## Usage

Get all dependencies with "lein deps" and invoke "lein compile" to compile the comet.HelloService Java class. In the hello-cometd.core namespace you can start the Jetty Server by evaluating the line (def server (start-server)). Alternatively you can do the following in the REPL:
(use 'hello-cometd.core)
(def server (start-server))

After that step open your Browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to see the example.
